/**
 * An implementation of RobotRulesCache that perfectly illustrates why you 
 * should never try writing your own caching code if you want to stay sane.
 * This is hideous, I want my life back!
 *
 * <p>Features:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The cache progressively acquires robots txt files and parses them as required.
 *       The passed in HttpClient is used to fetch the robots txt file.</li>
 *   <li>Supports multiple user agents but the cache structure is best for
 *       when there are fewer user agents.</li>
 *   <li>The cache of robot rules is a subset of the robots.txt file that applies
 *       just to the user agent in questions. This means that directives for
 *       common agents like Googlebot and Yahoo are not stored. The tradeoff is
 *       that the robots txt file has to be re-fetched for each user agent
 *       used by the crawler, which in practice many never be more than once.</li>
 *   <li>A cache entry for a particular website and user agent combination expires
 *       after a pre-defined period after which time robots txt would be fetched again.
 *       Even the cached record of a lack of robots txt file is evicted.</li>
 *   <li>Default expiry of cached entries would be 7 days, but is 1 day because 
*        there is no checking of server cache expiry so 1 day is a good compromise.</li>
 *   <li>Ideally only one cache created per VM.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <blockquote><em>
 *    There are only two hard things in Computer Science: 
 *    cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton
 * </em></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>This cache probably screws up on both counts!</p>
 *
 * <p>Internally the cache stores entries in a map of maps keyed at the 
 * highest level by user agent on the likelihood that there may be many
 * crawl jobs running with each using more or less the same agent.
 * A cache entry is an Option set to None when robots.txt was not found. 
 * The cache evicts the entry after it expires and re-fetches robots.txt.</p>
 *
 * <p>The cache structure can be visualised like this:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 *   "All agents: *" ->
 *       http://site.com -> SiteEntry(Some(RobotRules), expiry)
 *       http://site.com:8080 -> SiteEntry(Some(RobotRules), expiry)
 *       http://site_with_no_rules.com -> SiteEntry(None, expiry)
 *       http://othersite_with_no_rules.com:8080 -> SiteEntry(None, expiry)
 *
 *   "Custom User Agent" ->
 *       map of cache entries ...
 *
 *   "Custom User Agent" ->
 *       map of cache entries ...
 *
 * </pre>
